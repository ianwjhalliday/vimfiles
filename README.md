Ianwjhalliday's vim configuration
=================================

Thanks to [Mislav][] whose [blog post][] about getting
back into vim inspired myself to get back into vim.
Also thanks to [PeepCode][] for their vim screencasts
which also got me excited to get back into vim.

So far my configuration is still newbish. I've got a
good starting vimrc (gvimrc) and I'm happily sharing
it between Windows and Mac installations of gvim and
MacVim.

Time to start adding plugins and custom mappings!
